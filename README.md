One of the first HTML/JS/CSS) I created as a simple web application (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) to assist the Miami Indian tribe in revitalizing their language. It consisted of several different sections each with 3 modules. One of the modules is a video showing the student the words and objects that they will be learning, another module has a list of those objects that the student can click on to listen to the Myaamia word for that object, and the final module is an interactive game that tests the students knowledge of the words they should have learned in the section. I was personally responsible for developing an entire site. I worked with the client to develop an optimal way to have each module of each section designed. Once each section and module was designed I developed or modified each module of each section to continually fit those specifications.
